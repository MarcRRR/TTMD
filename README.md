# TTMD

This set of programs are used to apply Thermic Titration Molecular Dynamics to a protein-ligand complex previously treated with fragment dissolved Molecular Dynamics.
This code is divided in four parts:

R20_TTMD : creates the files needed for the execution of the dynamic and prepares it. 
R21_TTMDAnalysis : separates trajectories and explores binding sites. 
R22_TTMDDescriptors : analyses interaction energy at some points of the dnamic for comparison from the beginning. 
R23_TTMDStatistics: creates graphical visualization from the data.
